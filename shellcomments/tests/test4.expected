 Description:
## END INIT INFO
 for ntfs-3g to get correct file name encoding

 Mount local file systems in /etc/fstab.

 May have been mounted read-only by initramfs.
 Remount with unmodified options from /etc/fstab.
 We might have mounted something over /run; see if
 /run/initctl is present.  Look for
 /usr/share/sysvinit/update-rc.d to verify that sysvinit (and
 not upstart) is installed).
 Create new control channel
 Reopen control channel.
 Execute swapon command again, in case we want to swap to
 a file on a now mounted filesystem.
 Remount tmpfs filesystems; with increased VM after swapon,
 the size limits may be adjusted.
 Now we have mounted everything, check whether we need to
 mount a tmpfs on /tmp.  We can now also determine swap size
 to factor this into our size limit.
 No-op
